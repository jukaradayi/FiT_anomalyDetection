Installation
============

Requirements
------------

You need a g++ compilator compatible with C++14

NetworKit installation
----------------------

First you need to install networkit as a library :

```
mkdir </PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/> # choose a directory where you will install networkit library
git clone --recursive https://github.com/networkit/networkit.git
cd networkit
mkdir build && cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/> ..
make -j5 && make install
```
An error might occur where `ttmath` headers are not copied in the library. You need to check if `</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/include/ttmath/` is empty.
If it is empty, copy the content of `networkit/extlibs/ttmath/ttmath/` into `</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/include/ttmath/`

Project compilation
-------------------

When NetworKit is installed, you can compile the project:

g++ main.cpp G_graph.cpp history_graph.cpp H_graph.cpp PLM.cpp metrics.cpp -L</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/lib -I</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/include -lnetworkit -std=c++14 -fopenmp -O3

Docker
======

WIP : a docker image containing the compiled program is in progress
