FiT anomaly detection
---------------------

Description
===========

Given a link stream in input, aggregate the stream into different graph sizes and compute features for each interaction.

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

You need a g++ compilator compatible with C++14, cmake (>=3.10), networkit and catch2 ( https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2 )

NetworKit installation
----------------------

First you need to install networkit as a library :

```
mkdir </PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/> # choose a directory where you will install networkit library
git clone --recursive https://github.com/networkit/networkit.git
cd networkit
mkdir build && cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/> ..
make -j5 && make install
```
An error might occur where `ttmath` headers are not copied in the library. You need to check if `</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/include/ttmath/` is empty.
If it is empty, copy the content of `networkit/extlibs/ttmath/ttmath/` into `</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/include/ttmath/`

Then 

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=</PATH/TO/NETWORKIT/LIB/>/lib
```

Project compilation
-------------------

When NetworKit is installed, you can compile the project:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make 
```

You can then run the unit tests to ensure that everything works as intended:

```
./tests
```

Usage
-----

The parameter order is important.
The parameters noted as "required" are mandatory, the "optional"  are not.
: 
```
    ./fit.bin  [required] -f <Path To CSV> -o <Path To Output Folder> -h <List Of H Sizes> -g <List Of G Sizes> -k <Bound On The Degree> [optional] -m1 -m2 -m3 -p -b
```

Example (for 1 run with 1 history graph H of size 1024) :
```
    ./fit.bin  -f uci/uci.010/added_links.txt -o uci_output/ -h 1024 -g -k 10  -m1 -m2 -p
```

Optional parameters [see below for list of metrics toggled by m1, m2 and m3): 

-m1 : toggles basic metrics

-m2 : toggles local metrics (in O(k), O(kÂ²))

-m3 : toggles more intensive metrics

-p : when enabled, compute projection graph, and output metrics on them

-b : enable when the input graph is bipartite



Using Docker (DEPRECATED - TODO: update) 
------------

Build the docker image using 

  docker build -t getting-started .

To use the docker, you then have to create a data/ folder inside your current directory, put your <file> in data/, then run using 

  docker run -v $PWD/data:/mnt/data -it getting-started <file> <njobs>
